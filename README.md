📌 Project Overview — Zero-Shot Intent Classification Demo

This project demonstrates Zero-Shot Text Classification using Hugging Face’s facebook/bart-large-mnli transformer model. Unlike traditional classifiers, this model does not require any prior training on specific categories. Instead, you can provide custom labels on the fly, and the model assigns probabilities indicating how likely the text belongs to each label.
